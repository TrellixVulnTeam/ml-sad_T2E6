# SAD: Sliced Anti-symmetric Decomposition for Collaborative Filtering

![icon](artifacts/logo_small.png)

## Introduction

This repo implements a collaborative filtering model with a novel tensor decomposition
approach named **S**liced **A**nti-symmetric **D**ecomposition (SAD). In addition to the
implementation of the new model SAD, one can find several state of the art (SOTA) models
for recommendations in this repo. From this perspective, this library can be viewed as
an integration of SOTA recommendation models in a more or less principled manner such
that benchmarking can be easily performed.

Detailed API documentation can be found [here](https://pages.github.pie.apple.com/aiml-oss/ml-sad/).

## About SAD Model

SAD is a new model for collaborative filtering based on implicit feedback. In contrast
to traditional techniques where a latent representation of users (user vectors) and
items (item vectors) are estimated, SAD introduces one additional latent vector to each
item, using a novel three-way tensor view of user-item interactions. This new vector
extends user-item preferences calculated by standard dot products to general inner
products, producing interactions between items when evaluating their relative
preferences. SAD reduces to SOTA collaborative filtering models when the vector collapses
to one. In SAD we allow its value to be estimated from data. The model of SAD is simple,
resulting two efficient algorithms for parameter estimation. The
first one uses simple group stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with only first
order derivatives. In the second algorithm we develop an efficient Gibbs sampler for
parameter estimation under Bayesian inference framework. The Gibbs sampler allows us to
accurately characterize uncertainties of parameter estimates.

Extensive simulation studies have demonstrated the power of SAD model and the
effectiveness of inference algorithms we have developed. With the SGD algorithm, SAD is
able to converge to accurate parameter estimates in a few dozens of SGD updates,
producing practical effeciency *on par*, if not better, than the Bayesian Personalized
Ranking (BPR) model. In benchmarking with SOTA models on real datasets including Netflix
Prize, Movie-Lens 1M and Amazon Fine-Food Review data, SAD is able to produce
personalized item preferences mostly consistent with ground truth, beating **all** SOTA
models considered above with a large margin.
